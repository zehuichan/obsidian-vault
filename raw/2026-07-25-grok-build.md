# Grok Build (`grok`)

**Grok Build** is SpaceXAI's terminal-based AI coding agent. It runs as a full-screen TUI that understands your codebase, edits files, executes shell commands, searches the web, and manages long-running tasks — interactively, headlessly for scripting/CI, or embedded in editors via the Agent Client Protocol (ACP).

**Learn more about Grok Build at [x.ai/cli](https://x.ai/cli)**

This repository contains the Rust source for the `grok` CLI/TUI and its agent runtime. It is synced periodically from the SpaceXAI monorepo.

A small `SOURCE_REV` file at the root records the full monorepo commit SHA for the version of the code present in this tree.

Repository: [github.com/xai-org/grok-build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build) · Apache-2.0 · ~22.4k stars (as of clip date)

## Installing the released binary

Prebuilt binaries are published for macOS, Linux, and Windows:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash   # macOS / Linux / Git Bash
irm https://x.ai/cli/install.ps1 | iex          # Windows PowerShell
grok --version
```

See the [changelog](https://x.ai/build/changelog) for the latest fixes, features, and improvements in each release.

## Building from source

Requirements:

- **Rust** — the toolchain is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`; `rustup` installs it automatically on first build.
- **[DotSlash](https://dotslash-cli.com)** — required so hermetic tools under `bin/` (notably `bin/protoc`) can download and run. Install it and ensure `dotslash` is on your `PATH` **before** building:

  ```sh
  cargo install dotslash
  # or: prebuilt packages — https://dotslash-cli.com/docs/installation/
  /usr/bin/env dotslash --help   # sanity check
  ```

- **protoc** — proto codegen resolves `bin/protoc` via DotSlash, or falls back to a `protoc` on `PATH` / `$PROTOC`.
- macOS and Linux are supported build hosts; Windows builds are best-effort and not currently tested from this tree.

```sh
cargo run -p xai-grok-pager-bin              # build + launch the TUI
cargo build -p xai-grok-pager-bin --release  # release binary: target/release/xai-grok-pager
cargo check -p xai-grok-pager-bin            # fast validation
```

The binary artifact is named `xai-grok-pager`; official installs ship it as `grok`. On first launch it opens your browser to authenticate — see the authentication guide in the user docs.

## Documentation

Full online documentation is available at [docs.x.ai/build/overview](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview).

The user guide ships with the pager crate: `crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/` — getting started, keyboard shortcuts, slash commands, configuration, theming, MCP servers, skills, plugins, hooks, headless mode, sandboxing, and more.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager-bin` | Composition-root package; builds the `xai-grok-pager` binary |
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager` | The TUI: scrollback, prompt, modals, rendering |
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell` | Agent runtime + leader/stdio/headless entry points |
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-tools` | Tool implementations (terminal, file edit, search, ...) |
| `crates/codegen/xai-grok-workspace` | Host filesystem, VCS, execution, checkpoints |
| `crates/codegen/...` | The rest of the CLI crate closure (config, MCP, markdown, sandbox, ...) |
| `crates/common/`, `crates/build/`, `prod/mc/` | Small shared leaf crates pulled in by the closure |
| `third_party/` | Vendored upstream source (Mermaid diagram stack) |

> **Important:** The root `Cargo.toml` (workspace members, dependency versions, lints, profiles) is **generated** — treat it as read-only. Prefer editing per-crate `Cargo.toml` files.

## Development

```sh
cargo check -p <crate>        # always target specific crates; full-workspace builds are slow
cargo test -p xai-grok-config # per-crate tests
cargo clippy -p <crate>       # lint config: clippy.toml at the repo root
cargo fmt --all               # rustfmt.toml at the repo root
```
