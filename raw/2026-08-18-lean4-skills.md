# Lean 4 Skills

Lean 4 workflow pack for AI coding agents. Gives your agent a structured
prove/review/golf loop, mathlib search, axiom checking, and safety guardrails.
The workflows are host-agnostic — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and
others all use the same core skill; only the invocation surface differs.

## Quick Start

| Host | Recommended installation | What you get | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Native plugin (Tier 3) | Skill + `/lean4:*` commands, hooks, guardrails, subagents, helper runtime | [Claude Code](INSTALLATION.md#claude-code-native-plugin) |
| Codex | Native plugin (Tier 3) | Skill + trusted hooks + absolute-path helper runtime; no `/lean4:*` parity | [Codex](INSTALLATION.md#openai-codex-cli) |
| Other Agent Skills hosts (Gemini, Antigravity, Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, …) | Skill-only quick install | Instructions + references (documented, not CI-verified) | [Installation guide](INSTALLATION.md) |
| Any host, full runtime | Portable checkout (Tier 2) | Skill + wrappers + helper scripts | [Portable](INSTALLATION.md#portable-checkout--helper-runtime-all-hosts) |

**Claude Code** (run in chat):

```text
/plugin marketplace add cameronfreer/lean4-skills
/plugin install lean4
```

**Codex** (in your shell):

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add cameronfreer/lean4-skills --ref main
codex plugin add lean4@lean4-skills
```

> Host-native skill installers generally provide the instructions and
> references only. Use the portable runtime when you also need the bundled
> wrappers and scripts; Claude Code and Codex provide native full-plugin
> installations.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Description |
|---|---|
| draft | Draft Lean declaration skeletons from informal claims |
| formalize | Interactive formalization — drafting plus guided proving |
| autoformalize | Autonomous end-to-end formalization from informal sources |
| prove | Guided cycle-by-cycle theorem proving |
| autoprove | Autonomous multi-cycle proving with explicit stop budgets |
| disprove | Guided counterexample search with certified refutation |
| checkpoint | Save point (per-file + project build, axiom check, commit) |
| review | Read-only quality review |
| refactor | Leverage mathlib, extract helpers, simplify proof strategies |
| golf | Improve proofs for directness, clarity, performance, and brevity |
| learn | Interactive teaching and mathlib exploration |
| diagnose | Diagnostics and migration help |

**Claude Code:** invoke as `/lean4:<name>`. **Other hosts:** follow the corresponding workflow in [SKILL.md](plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/SKILL.md).

Typical session: `draft` (or `formalize` / `autoformalize`) → `prove` (or `autoprove`) → `review` → `refactor` → `golf` → `checkpoint` → `git push`. Use `disprove` instead of `prove` to refute a statement rather than prove it.

CLI-like inputs to the seven parameter-heavy commands are validated by a host-agnostic parser — see the [Command Invocation Contract](plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/references/command-invocation.md).

## The Shared Proof Cycle

The proving workflows (`prove`, `autoprove`, `formalize`, and `autoformalize`) share one cycle — **Plan → Work → Checkpoint → Review → Replan → Continue/Stop** — where each sorry gets a mathlib search, tactic attempts, and validation, and being stuck forces a review + replan. Statement and header changes belong to the synthesis workflows (`formalize` / `autoformalize`); `prove` and `autoprove` keep declaration headers immutable. Editing `.lean` files without a command runs one bounded pass — fix the immediate issue, then hand off to the right workflow — with the [Blocked-Goal Triage loop](plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/references/sorry-filling.md#blocked-goal-triage) for a goal that resists it. Details: [cycle-engine.md](plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/references/cycle-engine.md).

## Verification

CI gates every PR: full documentation lint, semantic contract suites, hook and wrapper runtime tests on Linux and macOS Bash 3.2, and pinned shellcheck/ruff/mypy/actionlint. Hosts marked "documented" in the Quick Start table follow verified setup patterns but are not CI-tested.

## Lean LSP MCP (Optional, Recommended)

The skill works standalone, but pairs best with [lean-lsp-mcp](https://github.com/oOo0oOo/lean-lsp-mcp): live goal inspection, mathlib search, and typically much faster feedback than repeated full builds. See [INSTALLATION.md → MCP Server](INSTALLATION.md#lean-lsp-mcp-server-all-hosts) for registration on any host, including the Claude Code scope trade-off for subagent visibility.

# Installation Guide

## Installation Tiers

Three install shapes, referenced throughout this guide:

- **Tier 1 — Core skill only.** Host-native installers or direct
  skill-directory copies/links. Installs or copies
  `plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/` — SKILL.md, bundled references, and
  OpenAI UI metadata. It does **not** install the helper runtime
  (`lean4-skills-*` wrappers and their scripts) or register plugin
  commands, lifecycle hooks, or subagent definitions. What you get is
  the instructions and references: the skill's LSP-first workflows
  operate when your host separately provides Lean LSP tools (see
  [Lean LSP MCP Server](#lean-lsp-mcp-server-all-hosts)); script-backed
  steps need Tier 2 or Tier 3.
- **Tier 2 — Portable checkout + helper runtime.** One cloned checkout,
  an `.agents/skills` symlink for native discovery, and one environment
  block. Adds the helper runtime (wrappers on PATH, `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS`) to
  the core skill. Does not recreate host-specific commands, hooks, or
  subagent definitions. See
  [Portable Checkout + Helper Runtime](#portable-checkout--helper-runtime-all-hosts).
- **Tier 3 — Native plugin.** Host-native discovery plus the bundled helper
  runtime and hooks. Claude Code registers `/lean4:*` commands and subagents;
  Codex discovers `$lean4`, injects absolute helper paths through trusted
  SessionStart context, and registers advisory hooks. Host command surfaces
  are not assumed to be identical.

## Claude Code (Native Plugin)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add cameronfreer/lean4-skills
/plugin install lean4
```

That's it! The skill activates automatically when working with `.lean` files.

### Verify

```
/lean4:diagnose
```

### Platform Notes

#### Windows

**Option 1: VSCode Extension (recommended)**
- Install [Claude Code for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code)
- No Bash required

**Option 2: Git Bash**
- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Use Git Bash for Claude Code CLI

#### macOS / Linux

No special setup required.

### Troubleshooting

#### Plugin Not Loading

1. Check installation: `/plugin list`
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Run `/lean4:diagnose`

#### LSP Server Not Working

1. Verify installation: https://github.com/oOo0oOo/lean-lsp-mcp
2. Run `lake build` in your project first (avoids timeouts). If fresh clone/worktree or after `lake clean`, prime cache first: `lake cache get` or `lake exe cache get`.
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Test: try `lean_goal` on a `.lean` file

#### Environment Variables Not Set

The `LEAN4_SCRIPTS` etc. variables are set by the bootstrap hook. If missing:
1. Restart Claude Code session
2. Check `/lean4:diagnose env`

#### Scripts Not Executable

The `lean4-skills-*` wrappers under `$LEAN4_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/` are shipped
executable. Confirm with:

```bash
command -v lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer
```

If you invoke the unwrapped internals under `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/` directly
(e.g. test fixtures, internal helpers), and a fresh clone left them
non-executable:

```bash
chmod +x $LEAN4_SCRIPTS/*.sh $LEAN4_SCRIPTS/*.py
```

## Portable Checkout + Helper Runtime (All Hosts)

The portable full-runtime fallback for hosts without a native plugin, or for
users who prefer an explicit checkout. Claude Code and Codex have Tier-3
native plugins; the remaining hosts use this Tier-2 path.
Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini CLI all
discover Agent Skills from `~/.agents/skills` (and its project-level
`.agents/skills` counterpart); Codex documents symlink support — for a
host that doesn't state it or doesn't follow symlinks, copy instead.
Antigravity CLI reads `.agents/skills` at project scope only — its
global path needs a separate link (see
[Antigravity CLI](#antigravity-cli)).

One maintained checkout, one link:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cameronfreer/lean4-skills.git "$HOME/.local/share/lean4-skills"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/skills"
src="$HOME/.local/share/lean4-skills/plugins/lean4/skills/lean4"
dest="$HOME/.agents/skills/lean4"
if [ -e "$dest" ] && [ ! -L "$dest" ]; then
  if mv "$dest" "$dest.bak-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)-$$"; then
    ln -sfn "$src" "$dest"
  else
    printf 'Could not back up %s; leaving it unchanged.\n' "$dest" >&2
  fi
else
  ln -sfn "$src" "$dest"
fi
```

The backup guard matters when upgrading from a Tier-1 copy: `ln -sfn`
replaces an existing sym*link* but not an existing real directory —
linking without the guard would nest the link inside the old copy
(`lean4/lean4`) while the stale top-level copy stays active. The copy
is moved aside, not deleted, in case it carries local changes — and if
the backup itself fails, nothing is linked and the message above is
printed instead. Remove the `.bak-*` directory once the link is
confirmed working.

Then add the environment block to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`,
`~/.zshrc`, …). This is the canonical copy — the host sections below
link here instead of repeating it:

```bash
export LEAN4_PLUGIN_ROOT="$HOME/.local/share/lean4-skills/plugins/lean4"
export LEAN4_SCRIPTS=$LEAN4_PLUGIN_ROOT/lib/scripts
export LEAN4_REFS=$LEAN4_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/lean4/references
export PATH="$LEAN4_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin:$PATH"   # so `lean4-skills-*` wrappers resolve
```

### Verify

```bash
command -v lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer
# expected: …/lean4-skills/plugins/lean4/bin/lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer
lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer . --format=summary --report-only
```

### Portability notes

- The helper runtime requires a POSIX-compatible shell. On Windows use
  WSL or Git Bash; without one, use a Tier-1 copy (below) — the skill's
  LSP-first workflows don't need the scripts.
- GUI hosts must actually inherit the shell-profile exports to see the
  wrappers. If `command -v lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer` succeeds in your
  terminal but the agent can't find it, launch the app from that
  terminal or set the variables in the host's own environment settings.

### Windows copy variant (no symlink)

The `Remove-Item` / `rm -rf` first matters: copying onto an existing
destination directory nests the source inside it (`lean4/lean4`),
leaving the discovered top-level skill stale.

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $HOME\.agents\skills
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue $HOME\.agents\skills\lean4
Copy-Item -Recurse "$HOME\.local\share\lean4-skills\plugins\lean4\skills\lean4" $HOME\.agents\skills\lean4
```

Git Bash equivalent:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
rm -rf ~/.agents/skills/lean4
cp -r "$HOME/.local/share/lean4-skills/plugins/lean4/skills/lean4" ~/.agents/skills/lean4
```

A copy does not track the checkout — re-run the replace-copy above
after each update.

### Update

```bash
git -C "$HOME/.local/share/lean4-skills" pull
```

The symlink keeps pointing at the updated checkout; copies must be
replaced (delete, then re-copy — see the copy variant above).

### Uninstall

```bash
rm -f "$HOME/.agents/skills/lean4"        # rm -rf if you copied
rm -rf "$HOME/.local/share/lean4-skills"
```

Then remove the environment block from your shell profile.

## OpenAI Codex CLI

### Native plugin (Tier 3 — recommended)

Add the Git marketplace and install the in-place `lean4` plugin:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add cameronfreer/lean4-skills --ref main
codex plugin add lean4@lean4-skills
```

The marketplace contains a Codex adapter pointing directly at
`plugins/lean4`; it does not install a mirrored package tree and does not
include `lean4-contribute`.

#### First-run hook trust

Codex does not automatically trust installed plugin hooks. Before trust:

- `$lean4` remains discoverable as a core skill.
- SessionStart does not inject helper paths.
- UserPromptSubmit validation and Bash PreToolUse guardrails are skipped.

Open `/hooks`, review the exact installed `lean4` hook commands, and trust the
hook hash. Then start a new Codex task so SessionStart runs again. Trusted
SessionStart supplies the installed `plugin_root`, `bin_dir`, `scripts_dir`,
`refs_dir`, and absolute preflight path as context. These are not persistent
shell variables: invoke helpers with literal paths such as
`/installed/plugin/bin/lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer`, not as bare commands.

The PreToolUse Bash hook is advisory. Codex interception does not cover every
specialized or hosted execution path, so this hook is not a security or
enforcement boundary. The plugin also does not register Claude Code's
`/lean4:*` slash commands; invoke `$lean4` and ask for the named workflow.

#### Verify

```bash
codex plugin list
```

In Codex:

1. Type `$` and confirm `lean4` appears.
2. Open `/hooks` and confirm the installed hook is trusted.
3. Start a new task and inspect the SessionStart context.
4. Run the literal absolute preflight path from that context:

```bash
/installed/plugin/bin/lean4-skills-preflight --codex
```

The preflight must succeed even when `LEAN4_*` are unset and the plugin's
`bin/` directory is absent from PATH.

#### Update or uninstall

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade lean4-skills
codex plugin add lean4@lean4-skills
```

Review the new hook hash after an update, then start a new task. To remove the
plugin:

```bash
codex plugin remove lean4@lean4-skills
```

### Core skill only (Tier 1 fallback)

Run this in Codex chat, not in your shell:

```text
$skill-installer Install the `lean4` skill from
https://github.com/cameronfreer/lean4-skills/tree/main/plugins/lean4/skills/lean4
```

On your next turn, invoke it explicitly with `$lean4`, or let Codex activate
it automatically for Lean 4 tasks. If it does not appear, restart Codex. This
installs instructions, references, and metadata only — not helper executables,
plugin hooks, subagent definitions, or a `/lean4:*` command surface.

> `$skill-installer` manages its own install location under
> `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (`~/.codex/skills` by default), while manual
> checkout/link installs belong in `~/.agents/skills`. Don't assume or
> prescribe the installer's destination — after installing, verify that
> `$lean4` is discovered (type `$` or run `/skills`).

### Portable checkout (Tier 2 fallback)

Use the
[Portable Checkout + Helper Runtime](#portable-checkout--helper-runtime-all-hosts)
— Codex discovers `.agents/skills` in your project and home directory
and follows symlinked skill directories.

> **Moving from Tier 1 to Tier 2:** Codex does not merge duplicate
> same-name skills, so a `$skill-installer` copy under
> `$CODEX_HOME/skills/lean4` and the Tier-2 `~/.agents/skills/lean4`
> link can both appear. Remove the installer copy
> (`rm -rf "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/lean4"`) when you switch.

### Optional integrations

**`AGENTS.md` pointer.** `AGENTS.md` is for durable project
guidance, not installation. If your project uses one, a single line is
enough:

```markdown
For Lean 4 proving workflows, use the `lean4` skill ($lean4).
```

**MCP:** check the [Codex MCP docs](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/extend/mcp)
for the exact command — e.g.:

```bash
codex mcp add lean-lsp -- uvx lean-lsp-mcp
```

## Gemini CLI

> **Availability:** consumer Gemini CLI access (free / Google AI Pro /
> Ultra) transitioned to [Antigravity CLI](#antigravity-cli) on
> June 18, 2026
> ([announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/an-important-update-transitioning-gemini-cli-to-antigravity-cli/));
> Gemini CLI continues for Standard/Enterprise licenses and supported
> API-key users. The instructions below apply to supported Gemini CLI
> installations.

Gemini CLI has native Agent Skills: it discovers `.gemini/skills/` and
the portable `.agents/skills/` locations (project and user scope), so
the [Portable Checkout](#portable-checkout--helper-runtime-all-hosts)
symlink covers it (Tier 2 — recommended; the canonical environment
block lives there too). Alternatively, link the skill from your
checkout explicitly — from your shell, so `$HOME` expands (Gemini's
interactive `/skills link` passes the path through literally, without
shell expansion):

```bash
gemini skills link "$HOME/.local/share/lean4-skills/plugins/lean4/skills/lean4" --scope user
```

**Quick install (Tier 1 — core skill only):**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/cameronfreer/lean4-skills.git \
  --path plugins/lean4/skills/lean4 --scope user
```

This copies the skill directory only — see
[Installation Tiers](#installation-tiers) for what that excludes.

### Verify

Run `/skills list` in Gemini — `lean4` should appear. With the full
setup, also:

```bash
command -v lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer
lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer . --format=summary --report-only
```

### Antigravity CLI

Antigravity CLI (Gemini CLI's consumer successor) retains Agent
Skills. It discovers workspace skills at `.agents/skills/` (project
scope), but its **global** skills live at
`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/` — the portable `~/.agents/skills`
link does *not* cover it. Global Tier-2 link from the portable
checkout (same move-aside guard as the portable section, in case a
Tier-1 copy is already there):

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills"
src="$HOME/.local/share/lean4-skills/plugins/lean4/skills/lean4"
dest="$HOME/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/lean4"
if [ -e "$dest" ] && [ ! -L "$dest" ]; then
  if mv "$dest" "$dest.bak-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)-$$"; then
    ln -sfn "$src" "$dest"
  else
    printf 'Could not back up %s; leaving it unchanged.\n' "$dest" >&2
  fi
else
  ln -sfn "$src" "$dest"
fi
```

Skill-only install (Tier 1) via GitHub CLI ≥ 2.96.0 — earlier gh
versions lack the `antigravity-cli` target, and the similarly named
`--agent antigravity` is a *different* surface that writes to
`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`:

```bash
gh skill install cameronfreer/lean4-skills lean4@main \
  --agent antigravity-cli --scope user
```

This lands at `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/lean4/`.

## Cursor

Cursor discovers Agent Skills natively from `.agents/skills/`,
`.cursor/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, and `~/.cursor/skills/` —
the [Portable Checkout](#portable-checkout--helper-runtime-all-hosts)
symlink covers it (Tier 2 — recommended; the canonical environment
block lives there, and Cursor runs commands in your shell). For a
skill-only install (Tier 1), copy `plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/` into
`.cursor/skills/lean4/` instead.

Invoke manually by typing `/lean4` in Agent chat, or let Cursor
activate the skill automatically for Lean 4 tasks. (The previous
`.cursor/rules/lean4.mdc` pattern is obsolete — native skills replace
project rules for this use.)

### Verify

Type `/lean4` in Agent chat — the skill should be listed. With the full
setup, open a `.lean` file and ask the agent to run:

```bash
lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer . --format=summary --report-only
```

## Windsurf

Windsurf (Cascade) discovers skills from `.windsurf/skills/` and
`~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/`, plus the portable `.agents/skills/` and
`~/.agents/skills/` locations — the
[Portable Checkout](#portable-checkout--helper-runtime-all-hosts)
covers it (Tier 2). For a skill-only install (Tier 1), copy
`plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/` into `.windsurf/skills/lean4/`.

Invoke manually with `@lean4` in Cascade. See the
[Windsurf skills docs](https://docs.devin.ai/desktop/cascade/skills)
for current behavior.

## OpenCode

OpenCode loads skills on demand through its native `skill` tool. It
discovers `.opencode/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/`
in the project, plus `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`,
and `~/.agents/skills/` globally — the
[Portable Checkout](#portable-checkout--helper-runtime-all-hosts)
covers it (Tier 2 — recommended; canonical environment block there).
Skill-only copy (Tier 1; the `rm -rf` keeps a re-copy from nesting
`lean4/lean4`):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills
rm -rf ~/.config/opencode/skills/lean4
cp -r "$HOME/.local/share/lean4-skills/plugins/lean4/skills/lean4" ~/.config/opencode/skills/
```

OpenCode supports MCP servers — see [OpenCode docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/)
for current MCP setup commands.

### Verify

Ask OpenCode to use the `lean4` skill — its `skill` tool should load
it. With the full setup, also:

```bash
command -v lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer
lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer . --format=summary --report-only
```

## GitHub Copilot

Copilot discovers Agent Skills in `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`,
and `.agents/skills/` (repository), plus `~/.copilot/skills/` and
`~/.agents/skills/` (personal) — the
[Portable Checkout](#portable-checkout--helper-runtime-all-hosts)
covers personal use (Tier 2). Skills work with the Copilot cloud coding
agent, Copilot CLI, and VS Code agent mode.

**Quick install (Tier 1 — core skill only)** with GitHub CLI ≥ 2.92.0
(`gh skill` is in public preview; 2.92 is the first version that
installs this repository's plugin-directory layout flat, the way this
guide describes). Use the plain `lean4` name — the namespaced
`lean4/lean4` selector works only for `preview`, not `install`. Use
`@main` — an install without it resolves the repository's latest
GitHub release, which lags `main`:

```bash
gh skill preview cameronfreer/lean4-skills lean4@main
gh skill install cameronfreer/lean4-skills lean4@main \
  --agent github-copilot --scope user
```

gh reports the skill's logical name as `lean4/lean4` and installs the
files at `<scope-skills-dir>/lean4/`.

This installs the skill directory only — see
[Installation Tiers](#installation-tiers) for what that excludes.

### Verify

```bash
gh skill list
```

`lean4` should appear. With the full setup, also
`command -v lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer`.

## Any Agent (Generic)

Any LLM coding agent that can read markdown and run shell commands can use this pack:

1. Do the [Portable Checkout + Helper Runtime](#portable-checkout--helper-runtime-all-hosts)
   setup — one clone, an optional `.agents/skills` link (if your agent
   supports skill discovery there), and the canonical environment block
2. Point your agent at `plugins/lean4/skills/lean4/SKILL.md` as system context
3. Scripts work standalone — no adapter needed:
   ```bash
   lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer . --format=summary --report-only
   lean4-skills-check-axioms-inline path/to/YourFile.lean --report-only
   lean4-skills-search-mathlib "continuous" name
   ```
4. If your agent supports MCP, add lean-lsp-mcp for faster mathlib search and sub-second feedback

### Verify

```bash
echo "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS"                        # shell-profile env block set the variable
command -v lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer        # wrapper resolves on PATH
lean4-skills-sorry-analyzer . --format=summary --report-only
```

## Lean LSP MCP Server (All Hosts)

[lean-lsp-mcp](https://github.com/oOo0oOo/lean-lsp-mcp) provides faster mathlib
search and sub-second feedback. Works with any MCP-capable host. Setup: a few minutes.

**What you get:**
- `lean_goal(file, line)` — See exact goal at cursor
- `lean_local_search("keyword")` — Fast local + mathlib (unlimited)
- `lean_leanfinder("goal or query")` — Semantic, goal-aware (rate-limited)
- `lean_leansearch("natural language")` — Semantic search (rate-limited)
- `lean_loogle("?a → ?b → _")` — Type-pattern (rate-limited)
- `lean_hammer_premise(file, line, col)` — Premise suggestions for simp/aesop/grind (rate-limited)
- `lean_multi_attempt(file, line, snippets=[...])` — Test multiple tactics
- `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` — Per-file error/warning check without a full `lake build`
- …and more (hover info, goal-conditioned search, state inspection, etc.)

**One-time setup:** ~5 minutes. Highly recommended.

Per-host MCP configuration (check each host's latest docs for current syntax):
- **Claude Code** (run from your Lean project root): `claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user lean-lsp -- uvx lean-lsp-mcp`. Project-scoped alternative (shared with collaborators via `.mcp.json`): `claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope project lean-lsp -- uvx lean-lsp-mcp`. User scope is recommended — it has been more reliable for keeping the MCP tools visible inside proof-editing subagents; project-scoped servers may not propagate to plugin subagents in some Claude Code versions.
- **Codex CLI:** Check [Codex docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/) for MCP setup
- **Gemini CLI:** Check [Gemini CLI docs](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) for MCP setup
- **OpenCode:** Check [OpenCode docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/) for MCP setup
- **Other hosts:** `npx lean-lsp-mcp --project /path/to/lean/project` — connect via your agent's MCP configuration

## Optional: ripgrep

Install `ripgrep` for faster searches:

```bash
# macOS
brew install ripgrep

# Linux
sudo apt install ripgrep

# Windows
winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC
```

The workflows and scripts work without it, but searches are slower.

## Migrating from V3 (Claude Code Only)

If you have the old 3-plugin system:

```bash
# Uninstall old plugins
/plugin uninstall lean4-theorem-proving
/plugin uninstall lean4-memories
/plugin uninstall lean4-subagents

# Install unified plugin
/plugin install lean4

# Verify
/lean4:diagnose
```

### What Changed

| V3 | V4 |
|----|-----|
| 3 plugins | 1 unified plugin |
